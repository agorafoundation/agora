Traditional communication aids, such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, have been instrumental in giving a voice to those who cannot speak. These devices range from simple picture boards to sophisticated speech-generating devices (SGDs) that can be customized to meet the specific needs of the user. However, the reliance on such devices often requires the presence of a computer or tablet, limiting the user's ability to communicate in situations where these tools are unavailable. This dependency underscores the need for innovative solutions that can bridge the gap when traditional assistive technologies are not accessible.

        Example Tone Explanation 1: The text provides a detailed and balanced overview of the progress and impact of assistive technology for communication, emphasizing both the benefits and limitations of traditional AAC devices. It highlights the significant advancements in the field and the vital support these technologies offer to individuals with disabilities. At the same time, it points out the dependency on devices such as computers or tablets and the necessity for innovative solutions to overcome these limitations. The overall tone of the text is objective.

        Example Output 1: "Progress", "Support", "Limitations", "Dependency", "Innovation"

        let example2 =  `Example Text 2: William Butler Yeats, an Irish poet who has heavily contributed to the Irish Literary Revival, was very cultured and very well-versed in the arts. His extensive knowledge and interest in history and in the arts helped him write some impressively magnificent poems throughout the course of his career. In turn, he has become very well renowned for his writing, for his use of different things throught history, and in the arts to convey strong themes in the messages of his poems. Specifically, Yeats was interested in Irish mythology since he used it in a vast amount of his work. His use of Irish mythology has been a distinguishing factor for his work, reminding the Irish nation of their ancient roots through various inspirations and allusions to several Irish myths and legends. In the poems âThe Song of Wandering Aengus,â âThe Stolen Child,â and âTo the Rose upon the Rood of Time,â W.B Yeats rekindles the connection between modern & ancient Irish culture through the use of Irish mythology to convey different themes among a plethora of his works, restoring a sense of Irish pride and identity by differing that part of their culture away from the Greek mythology and way of thinking.

       Example Tone Explanation 2: The text discusses William Butler Yeats' contributions to the Irish Literary Revival, emphasizing his cultured background and extensive knowledge in history and the arts. It highlights how these attributes enabled him to create magnificent poems that convey strong themes through historical and artistic references. The text particularly focuses on Yeats' interest in Irish mythology, noting how his use of these myths distinguishes his work and reconnects the Irish nation with its ancient roots. By examining specific poems, the text illustrates how Yeats bridges modern and ancient Irish culture, restoring a sense of pride and identity. The overall tone is reverent.
