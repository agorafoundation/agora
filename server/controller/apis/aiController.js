In turn, he has become very well renowned for his writing, for his use of different things throught history, and in the arts to convey strong themes in the messages of his poems. Specifically, Yeats was interested in Irish mythology since he used it in a vast amount of his work. His use of Irish mythology has been a distinguishing factor for his work, reminding the Irish nation of their ancient roots through various inspirations and allusions to several Irish myths and legends. In the poems âThe Song of Wandering Aengus,â âThe Stolen Child,â and âTo the Rose upon the Rood of Time,â W.B Yeats rekindles the connection between modern & ancient Irish culture through the use of Irish mythology to convey different themes among a plethora of his works, restoring a sense of Irish pride and identity by differing that part of their culture away from the Greek mythology and way of thinking.

His extensive knowledge and interest in history and in the arts helped him write some impressively magnificent poems throughout the course of his career. In turn, he has become very well renowned for his writing, for his use of different things throught history, and in the arts to convey strong themes in the messages of his poems. Specifically, Yeats was interested in Irish mythology since he used it in a vast amount of his work. His use of Irish mythology has been a distinguishing factor for his work, reminding the Irish nation of their ancient roots through various inspirations and allusions to several Irish myths and legends. In the poems âThe Song of Wandering Aengus,â âThe Stolen Child,â and âTo the Rose upon the Rood of Time,â W.B Yeats rekindles the connection between modern & ancient Irish culture through the use of Irish mythology to convey different themes among a plethora of his works, restoring a sense of Irish pride and identity by differing that part of their culture away from the Greek mythology and way of thinking.

Traditional communication aids, such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, have been instrumental in giving a voice to those who cannot speak. These devices range from simple picture boards to sophisticated speech-generating devices (SGDs) that can be customized to meet the specific needs of the user. However, the reliance on such devices often requires the presence of a computer or tablet, limiting the user's ability to communicate in situations where these tools are unavailable. This dependency underscores the need for innovative solutions that can bridge the gap when traditional assistive technologies are not accessible.
