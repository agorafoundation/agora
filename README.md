## The AI driven Research and Learning Platform [https://freeagora.org](https://freeagora.org)

> #### *"The natural can never be inferior to the artificial; art imitates nature, not the reverse. ... Now, all the arts move from the lower goals to higher ones. Won't nature do the same?"*. - Marcus Aurelius \ Meditations [11:10]

## Let's build the next generation of software together.
Agora is born of a moment. It is abundantly clear that AI will increase our productivity, help us make new connections and discoveries, and potentially make the world a better place. We know that technologies such as semantic search and generative AI improve vastly as the size of the context (our data) we provide increases. Having all lived through the birth of Web 2.0 we all watched as a few companies amassed immeasurable wealth by offering services that harvested the most valuable commodity, information. Our vision is to create a trusted platform, focused on the individual that allows people to safely collect their data in a cloud platform that is engineered to provide all the value of these data driven tools, but allowing them complete control over their data and serious value even when they choose to keep it 100% private.

Agora is an open, free, cloud based learning and research platform. It is a living experiment, built by educators, researchers and students to envision what is possible tomorrow, by building it today. Untethered by the past, a framework for developing the next generation of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) driven by safe AI interacting privately with your data. Its architecture is simple, fast and light, a solid core that allows endless experimentation in semantic search and generative AI assistance. We envision it growing into your cloud based operating system of the future. 

Protected by the Agora Foundation, a Public Service charged with protecting individual data as a service rendered in the public interest, ensuring your privacy and ownership of data within the system now and for the lifetime of the foundation!

## Agora's guiding principles:
- Accessible: Free and open source and will remain so forever
- Feedback: Agora will keep the loop closed, using visualizations and chain of thought reasoning.
- User Centric: Lifelong learners require a lifelong system - not the institutions they are affiliated with.
- Collaborative: Agora can help you make new connections based on the semantic meaning of your data, true connections with like-minded people working on related problems.
- Safe: Your data will never be used against you, only for you. it will not be sold or used for marketing and is only seen by people you authorize.
- Smart: It can suggest helpful resources getting you closer to the answers you seek
- Listens: To its users, the sum of its parts, always remains a force for good.
### Above all: The mission must remain first.

Agora is open source, and easy to install if you want to manage a local installation or set up a development environment to contribute to its growth.
Before working with Agora source please read the [Contributor code of conduct](https://github.com/agorafoundation/agora?tab=coc-ov-file#readme) and the [security policy](https://github.com/agorafoundation/agora?tab=security-ov-file#readme). Also be aware that the Agora source is protected by the [BSD 3-clause License](https://github.com/agorafoundation/agora?tab=BSD-3-Clause-1-ov-file#readme).

### Dependencies:
 * Postgres 
 * Node.js
 * That's it!

## Database setup
* You can either run /server/db/createDatabase.sql or create a copy and modify / comment out default data to your liking
> from the project home: psql -U postgres -f server/db/createDatabase.sql
> (default agora user password is 'agora')
* Run the script to create the database.  If you run the script with postgres / root user it will create a database and user named 'agora', then connect to the new database and create the schema using the agora user.

### Quick start setup
1. After ensuring that Node.js and PostgreSQL are installed and working
2. clone this git repo
    > git clone https://github.com/briangormanly/agora.git  
    > cd agora  
3. *Make a copy of the .env.example file called .env in the project home directory* 
4. In the .env file: 
    1. Note the FRONT_END_NAME in the future you can change this to use your own front end / Theme, set to agora by default. The theme is located in a folder of the same name in the client folder.
    2. Edit Postgres settings to connect to your database server (default shown)
        > PG_USER = agora  
        > PG_HOST = localhost  
        > PG_PASSWORD = agora  
        > PG_DATABASE = agora  
        > PG_PORT = 5432  
        > PG_SSL = false  
    3. Set a random session secret string 
        > SESSION_SECRET = EUOee33unt5haEAOUOMAKE_THIS_YOUR_OWNa34uei58355
    4. You can set email, stripe, GitHub and OpenAI integrations off by setting the following:
        > EMAIL_TOGGLE = false  
        > STRPIE_TOGGLE = false  
        > GITHUB_TOGGLE = false  
        > OPENAI_TOGGLE = false  
    5. To use any of these integrations (email is a good one as you will need it for user email verification and password reset) set the parameter to 'true' (lowercase without the single quotes). You must also then set all the affiliated settings for that integration.
    6. To use the openAI integrations you must apply your OpenAI API key, you should also provide a semantic scholar API key as this is used for sementic search and verification.
        > OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY  
        > SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY = API_KEY  
    7. Make sure not to commit any of your keys to Git! the .env is in the .gitignore by default but the .env.example file will be committed!
5. Save your .env file
6. Install dependencies 
    > npm i
7. Start the service
    > npm start

----- output ------
>
> Agora running... {localhost:4200}
7. Navigate your web browser to http://localhost:PORT (default port is 4200) if you are running on your local machine.
8. Nice!
